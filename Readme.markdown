### Game Setup
* Each player must present:
    * Deck of 5 objectives
    * Deck of characters with a total cost of 10 or fewer points
    * Deck of 50 cards, with no more than 3 copies of any card (by title). Only actions and items may be included in this deck

* One player must present a enter objective deck (right now this is a pile of all the objectives. need to work out this one)
* All characters are placed at the players home. 
* All objective decks are randomized and the top card revealed as the active objective.
* Starting with a randomly selected player, begin as describe below. 

### Phases

1. Start of Turn
    1. Each character gains 1 energy (remove a blue counter)
    2. Start of Turn Effects trigger
2. Movement
    1. Beginning with the lowest speed character (active player chooses in ties), each character may move. Valid moves are:
        * Any objective to Home
        * Home to any objective
        * Center objective to any objective
        * Any objective to center objective
    2. After movement phase triggers
3. Skirmish
    1. Beginning with the highest speed, create an action step for that speed
        
        Starting with the active player (and alternating) each character with a speed equal to or higher than the current step may perform one action (assuming he has not already done so). This allows a high speed character to pass and resume his action whenever he desires at a lower speed step.
    2. Once all characters have passed at speed 1, the skirmish phase is over
4. Draw
    1. Each player may discard any number of cards
    2. Each player draws up to 5 cards.
5 Respawn
    Each character that was killed the previous turn (not this one) is placed in the players home. 


### Actions

Each character can perform ONE action per turn. Those actions are:
    * Play an action card
    * Use an ability on an item with a pre-stated cost such as (1): draw a card. (potions do not take an action window to use, and can be used at any time)
    * If a character is at home, you may equip an item from your hand
    * Raze 2

To play an action card, the performing personality much match all skills on the card. If all skills match, the player places energy tokens on his character equal to the cost of the action. A player can never have more energy tokens than their energy stat (blue). If they do not have energy remaining, the action cannot be played. 

To equip an item, the personality must match all classes and elemental keywords. 

Reactions may be played in response to the trigger at any time. Using the reaction will consume the characters action for this turn, and cannot be performed if the character has already performed an action.

Taking an additional action must gives the performing character the ability to perform an addition action and must be performed by that character.

### Zones
Home: ALl characters start in the home. This is a safe territory in which no enemy units can move to, and has no adjacent locations.

Friendly Objective: Your current objective. You cannot raze this objective. Adjacent to the center objective.

Enemy Objective: Your opponent's objective. Raze effects damage this objective.Adjacent to the center objective

Center Objective: A neutral objective. Both players can Raze it, and it is score by the player who did the most damage to it (or last damage in case of a tie). Adjacent to both other objectives. 

Enemy Home: All enemy characters start here. Your characters cannot move here. 

### Characters

Characters are killed if they have wounds equal to their health (red). When a character is killed, it is placed in the players home at the end of the next turn with all energy and wound tokens removed. 

Whenever a character is killed, the player who killed the character may choose to either raze 2 at any location or draw a card. 

### Win Conditions

When a player destroys an objective, he scores one point. If any player has 4 or more points, that player wins. 

Additionally, if a player ever has zero cards left in his deck, that player loses.
